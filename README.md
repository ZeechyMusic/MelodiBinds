# MelodiBinds
Interprets MIDI device inputs as well as user defined Analog and Digital audio signals and acts as a translation layer to the operating system for creation of user specified keybinds.

If you have an old drum pad, midi piano, or want specific sounds to trigger keybinds within Windows, or any software based in Windows, including multi-key shortcut keybinds (i.e.  Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager), then this tool will allow you to assign notes, drum pads, and even real sound waves, both digitaly produced and natural produced analog sounds to interpret those as regular keyboard inputs.

This tool could be implemented as a workflow tool, or just be something to play around with, have fun and forget about after a few days. How you use this software is up to you.
